# about me 

my name is kyle and I am a computer programmer who hope one day to become a professional games programmer one day but apart from that I am an expert in AI systems and I have made all sorts of AI's from ones you can talk to like chat GPT (but in video game that dose not require wifi connection) to other AI which can search thought an environment using the most efficient algorithm to do so.

my favourite coding language is lua because of how simple (by this I mean ; are optional and error messages are detailed), fast, controllable (as in you can replace pretty much any function) and portable it is but I will also say c++ is my second favourite but I doubt you will see many if any c++ projects on here because I mostly just use git hub for transfering files between home and collage so I can work on them in my spare time at college but college dose not allow c++ on its computers.

# what I am working on right now in git hub
- publicAI: publicAI is a remade version of the AI system I made for a game called a chat with it and in this version there are all sorts of new fetures such as synonyms and spelling groups making the spellchecking it has to do work better and it is made in such a manner where you could get it to run any bit of lua code at almost any stage in the AI loop making it very easy to intergrate into any future game or program. this AI is also made to be taught manually via code and it cant do google searches but it can be easily used for anything and still seam a bit life like.
