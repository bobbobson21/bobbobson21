# about me 

my name is Kyle and I am a computer programmer who hopes one day to become a professional games programmer one day. Apart from that I am an expert in AI systems and I have made all sorts of AIs from ones you can talk to like chat GPT (but in video games that do not require a Wi-Fi connection) to other AIs that can search through an environment using the most efficient algorithm to do so.

my favorite coding language is Lua because of how simple (by this I mean; there are a lot of options and error messages are detailed), fast, controllable (as in you can replace pretty much any function), and portable it is. Still, c++ is my second favorite. Still, I doubt you will see many if any c++ projects on here because I mostly use git hub for transferring files between home and college so I can work on them in my spare time at college but college does not allow C++ on its computers.

# What I have worked on
- textual engine: this project is a game engine of sorts that combines many of the elements seen in both source and unreal engines. The main factor to this engine however is that it does everything through the Windows command line from rendering 

- publicAI: publicAI is a remade version of the AI system I made for a game called a chat with it. In this version, there are all sorts of new features such as synonyms and spelling groups making the spellchecking it has to be able to work better and it is made in such a manner that you could get it to run any bit of lua code at almost any stage in the AI loop making it very easy to intergrate into any future game or program. this AI is also made to be taught manually via code and it can't do Google searches but it can be easily used for anything and still seem a bit life-like.


# non git hub tasks I will most likely be working on if git hub activity is low
- game programming
- level design
- gmod addons, [addon page here](https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilikecreepers3334/myworkshopfiles/)
- university and or college work
- helping friends
